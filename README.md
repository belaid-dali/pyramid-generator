# Pyramid Generator

A simple web-based pyramid generator built with vanilla JavaScript. Users can define the pyramid height, choose the character used to build the pyramid, and optionally select the direction (standard or inverted). The output is displayed in a clean, styled interface.

## Features

- Set custom pyramid height
- Customize the pyramid character (default: `*`)
- Optionally choose pyramid direction (upright or inverted)
- Clean UI, responsive design
- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no dependencies
